The key exchange that is used was first based on RSA and later on (elliptic curve) Diffie-Hellman. The signatures used for authentication have almost always been RSA-based, though in recent years other kinds of signatures have been adopted, mainly ECDSA and Ed25519. This recent change to elliptic curve cryptography at both at a key exchange and signature level has resulted in considerable speed and bandwidth benefits in comparison to classic Diffie-Hellman and RSA.\nTLS is the main protocol that protects the connections we use everyday. It is everywhere: it is used when we buy products online, when we register for a newsletter or when we access any kind of website. But, with the imminent threat of the arrival of quantum computers (a threat that seems to be getting closer and closer), we need to reconsider again the future of TLS. A wide-scale post-quantum experiment was carried out by Cloudflare and Google: two post-quantum key exchanges were integrated into their TLS stack and deployed at their edge servers and in Chrome Canary clients. The goal of that experiment was to evaluate the performance and feasibility of deployment of two post-quantum key exchanges in TLS.\nSimilar experiments have been proposed for introducing post-quantum algorithms into the TLS handshake itself. But, they all seem infeasible to be introduced at authentication by signature and key exchange levels as, unfortunately, post-quantum cryptographic primitives are bigger, or slower (or both) than their predecessors. The proposed algorithms under consideration in the NIST post-quantum standardization process use larger mathematical objects than what is used for elliptic curves, traditional Diffie-Hellman or RSA. As a result, the size of public keys, signatures and key exchange material is much bigger than those from elliptic curves, Diffie-Hellman or RSA.\nHow can we solve this problem? How can we use post-quantum algorithms as part of the TLS handshake without making the material too big to be transmitted? In this blogpost, we will introduce a new mechanism for making this happen, explain how it can be integrated into the handshake and talk about implementation details. The key observation in this mechanism is that, while post-quantum algorithms have bigger communication size than their predecessors, post-quantum key exchanges have somewhat smaller sizes than post-quantum signatures, so we can try to replace key exchanges with signatures in some places to save space. We will only focus on the TLS 1.3 handshake as it is the TLS version that should be currently used.\nThe past experiments: making the traditional TLS 1.3 handshake post-quantum TLS 1.3 was introduced in August 2018 with many security and performance improvements (notably, having only one round-trip to complete the handshake). But TLS 1.3 is designed for a world with classical computers, and some of its functionalities will be broken by quantum computers when they arrive.\nThe primary goals of TLS 1.3 are to provide authentication (the server side of the channel is always authenticated, the client side is optionally authenticated), confidentiality and integrity by using a handshake protocol and a record protocol. The handshake protocol, the one of interest for us today, establishes the cryptographic parameters for securing and authenticating a connection. It can be thought of as of having three main phases, as defined in RFC8446:\n  The Parameter Negotiation phase (referred to as ‘Server Parameters’ in RFC8446), which establishes other handshake parameters (whether the client is authenticated, application-layer protocol support, etc).\n  The Key Exchange phase, which establishes shared keying material and selects the cryptographic parameters to be used. Everything after this phase will be encrypted.\n  The Authentication phase, which authenticates the server (and, optionally, the client) and provides key confirmation and handshake integrity.\n  The main idea of past experiments that introduced post-quantum algorithms into the handshake of TLS 1.3 was to use them in place of classical algorithms by advertising them as part of the supported groups (an extension used by the client to indicate which named groups -Elliptic Curve Groups, Finite Field Groups- it supports for key exchange) and key share (an extension which contains the endpoint’s cryptographic parameters) extensions, and, therefore, establishing with them the negotiated connection parameters.
